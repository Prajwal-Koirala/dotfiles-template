### dotfiles-template

***dotfiles-template is not yet complete. You should not rely on this code. It has not undergone proper degrees of security auditing and the protocol is still subject to change. We're working toward a stable 1.0.0 release, but that time has not yet come. There are experimental snapshots tagged with "0.0.0.MM-DD-YYYY", but these should not be considered real releases and they may contain security vulnerabilities (which would not be eligible for CVEs, since this is pre-release snapshot software). If you are packaging dotfiles-template, you must keep up to date with the snapshots.***

#### What exactly are dotfiles?
When viewing a directory listing, a hidden folder or hidden file is a folder or file that filesystem tools do not display by default. They are usually formed implicitly by using various utilities and are typically used for saving user preferences or preserving the state of a utility.
